# PvZLanguageInstaller
This is going to be a tool that will allow you to play Plants vs. Zombies: Game of the Year Edition in the language that you select. The current languages that will be included are: Spanish, German, Italian, and French.

Note: If you have any language packs for other language, please let me know and I will add them to this program.

After the core functions of the primitive batch version of this tool are completed, I may rewrite this in a different programming language and make it more advanced.
