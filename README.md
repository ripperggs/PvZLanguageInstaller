# PvZLanguageInstaller
This is going to be a tool that will allow you to play Plants vs. Zombies: Game of the Year Edition in the language that you select. The current languages that will be included are: Spanish, German, Italian, and French.

Note: If you have any language packs for other language, please let me know and I will add them to this program.

The reason I am creating this with batch is so that anyone who uses windows can run it without installing something like python. I may create a version of this program in a different programming language after the core functions are finished. If I do that, I will probably make it much more advanced in that version and will replace the batch version, but for now there will only be the primitive version.
